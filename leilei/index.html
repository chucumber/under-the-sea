        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; I recently read a few articles that talked about what kind of work won't become redundant in the future. It might be a combination of hands and brains, like carving flowers.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; More craft-like works.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; And I was thinking that learning dance might be the last job to be replaced. You can think about it, will it be the same to watch a robot dance as we watch a human dance? Will it be the same to watch a robot run as we watch a human run? So there is still a reason for athletes to exist, because we want to see people suffer <small>(laughs)</small>. To see people break through their limits is what really amazes us. If a robot runs faster than me, I won't be surprised, right?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; Sounds right. We prefer to see people suffer <small>(laughs)</small>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Right, only when they suffer, will you think, "Wow thankfully it's not me," and then, “Wow they can actually make it, amazing…” I feel that now many people seem to be turning towards a greater focus on tactile, and also on sensitivity, physical and mental health. There's stronger attention towards things like caring or nursing, which I think is related to the body and the mind, and is a continuation of this tactile or embodied awareness.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; You mean like meditation?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Hmm, not really…in my new projects like <i>Palace</i> and <i>Empty Touch</i>, they're sort of an inevitable attempt at meditation. After all, if you need a deeper tactile experience, you may inevitably go into a state that's a bit like meditation. It's about spending time touching anyway. But I think my focus is actually different from meditation. How should I put it… I think meditation focuses more on your improvement in the process. And with me, although I also focus on the process, I'm also interested in the result. In my tactile-based theater or like <i>Palace</i>, I want those invisible sculptures. I don't think they are a joke, so to speak. Even though I don't think they are “real”—I’m not saying it's exactly the same as this pillow or other stuff, but I do believe the invisible things have their philosophical meaning, or their meaning for life. It's a thing. If I am going to do tactile-based theater, it's not just about how you touch and feel. Um... so I think it's still a very animated logic, probably not like those healing projects, where you come in, relax your mood, and they don't care what shit you draw in the end. If it were me, I would care about what shit you drew and I need this shit to exist and spread, and become a certain kind of work. So I still have a certain insist on the work. I won't be like those exercises like meditation or yoga, they are not quite the same.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; You mentioned the invisible sculpture—it’s a term I've never heard before. Is this your own term or is it something widely used?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; It's a term I use myself, but to be honest, I don't really think that what I do is very...I mean, how is it possible that no one has thought of this before? I don't really believe it's a totally original thing. My background in art history is also quite shallow, so I don't dare to claim this thing. But so far, I haven't really taken any other references.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; I remember you said that the workshop was like a cult  <small>(laughs)</small>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; It does seem like a cult.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; But actually, I feel like the reason why the exercises are meaningful to me is because it's a group activity. If it were just me alone, I don't think I would want to do it. I wouldn't have the motivation to do it. But if it's with a group of people, I'm curious about how others feel about it. When last time I was doing it, I was excited to share with others what I came up with, and I wanted to know how others approach the creation process.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Yeah...there's definitely a certain atmosphere there, a motivation to share. Also, when someone does it alone, it might look like they're crazy. <small>(laughs)</small> Because it looks so weird. Of course, if you listen to me and go back to try it a few more times on your own, you might actually go crazy <small>(laughs)</small>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; Do you do it by yourself usually?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Actually, I do. There was a period of time when I would practice every night because I didn't know what project to do or how to do it. So, I would record an invisible sculpture every night. I still have a lot of those exercise videos saved on my hard drive. I think the feeling is quite interesting. You would discover certain patterns, things you frequently do and you do them subconsciously. For example, I like this certain shape—I can stretch it out, very long, and add a round button here—which gives me the feeling of blowing glass with my hands. And there's another shape that I used to do frequently in the workshop. When I was too lazy to try hard, I just did the same thing every time, and I prefer to make something like a gourd or a bent hook shape, or something with sharp corners.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; So when you practice this exercise yourself, do you give yourself the same prompt every time, or do you come up with a new one every day?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Hmm... when I first started doing it, I didn't think too much about it, so I didn't set too many prompts for myself... But after some time, maybe during a training period, I can try some other ways. Previously, I simply do it before going to bed every day. But after doing it every day, I found that the ball I made was generally related to my mood at that time. For example, when I was not in a good mood, the ball was often quite hard and had a metallic feeling, and it was also cooler. But when I was in a better mood, it would be more furry and elastic. It sounds cliché, right? but it's a direct correlation. After all, these textures, the furry texture make people feel good, right? It's soft and makes people feel good. Although it may have different meanings for everyone, there are some direct physiological suggestions. I think this is hard to avoid, and it is also reflected in the results of my invisible sculpture. In the future, um, there is another point. It's theoretically possible as an additional product, but I haven't delved into it yet. If the invisible sculpture you make every night is really related to your memories of that day, um... I think it can help you with your experience during the day. Actually, this is something I saw in a game for actors and non-actors, created by Augusto Boal. He was a theatre practitioner who establish the <i>Theatre of the Oppressed</i>. He wrote a book, and there was a game in the book about memory. For several consecutive days, you need to carefully remember what you experienced that day—what impressed you the most, every detail, every moment of feeling, smell, touch, and experience—which is actually difficult to remember, right? I can't even remember what I was doing an hour ago. I have an average memory. But if you do this every day and know that you need to think about this every night, you will actually invest a little more energy the next day to feel these things. And I think it is similar to the empty touch and the invisible sculpture. For example, when I know that I have to do this kind of sculpture every night, if I encounter something fascinating when I go out, like a little flower or something, instead of taking a photo, sometimes I would caress it and try to remember its texture as much as possible, so that I can recreate it in my palace, you know, I can record this tactile sensation. Interesting reactions like this may occur.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; It’s very interesting. It's like you're using this invisible sculpture as a diary or an archive of your life experiences.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Yes, to some extent. Although it's not very reliable.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; But I think the transition you talked about is quite interesting. Instead of taking photos, you use touch to remember it and then archive it in your palace.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Yes, I actually think that this is quite beneficial for art in general. I think that doing art often requires a lot of these sensory experiences and perceptions. Because pure logic can be quite formalized at times. And this may come back to the feeling that we talked about earlier, that there are some things that cannot be replaced by AI. I think that these aspects are quite similar in that they are difficult to quantify and require you to use your body to remember them. Even they may be difficult to express, and may only be useful to yourself in a certain sense.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; Actually, I myself have always felt that among the five senses, vision is the most rational one. I found that when I was very emotional, I rely on music—not necessarily music, like sounds—or touch to resonate with my own emotions or feelings. I think that when you are really upset or something, it’s difficult to say that looking at a certain scene would make me feel comforted. However, touching something that is fluffy, or listening to a song that I really like or a song that is in line with my mood, is actually more able to touch my heart.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; I think it makes sense. Indeed, there should be scientific research on this. The human visual processing is indeed a higher-level processing layer, and you have to deal with a lot of information. Visual information provides a particularly large amount of information. Humans are visual animals and primarily rely on vision. Humans can receive more visual information than many animals, but on the other hand, it is certainly more complex... and it involves a lot of our cognitive processing. For example. When it comes to running, they only use a starting gun, but they don't use a starting light because sound reaches your cognition faster than light. With light, you need to process and think about it, even if it's just a 0.1-second difference, it's still different.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; So that's why they use sound.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Yes, because it reaches your brain at a faster speed.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; I was just thinking, because compared to that, vision is probably a very well-trained thing, so it becomes, to some extent, that we have a lot of frameworks or presets or pre-existing... some pre-existing things in our visual interpretation. But on the other hand, the sense of smell, hearing, touch, taste, to some extent, they are still more wild, more untamed, right?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; I think hearing definitely has it too.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; Hearing might have a bit of it, comparatively.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Actually, I think vision is over-polluted, because there's just too much information. It applies to both vision and hearing. I think they both have this tendency to be over-polluted. Švankmajer also mentioned in his book that our visual culture is saturated with too much... we over-consume our vision to the point where it has become numb and dull. And as for touch and smell, for example, touch, most of the scenarios we use it in are very utilitarian, like weighing how heavy an object is or picking it up to make sure it's not hot, and so on. It's mostly practical uses, and we don't really use it as an aesthetic tool unless, for example, when selecting things, choosing based on the fabric, like "Oh, this fabric is really soft, I like it." But even the people who choose based on fabric are rare, they really pay attention to the fabric.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; People may pay more attention to the patterns.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Price, I would be concerned about the price <small>(laughs)</small>. Actually, when they are used or when we try to domesticate or aestheticize them, there is less emphasis on contextualizing them. However, there is still more potential in them. At least they have not been completely over-exploited. And at the same time, as I mentioned earlier, vision as a high-level processing system... um... this is also mentioned in another book <i>The Wonder of Touch</i>. The gradual order of a baby's sensory system is related to the hierarchy of vision, hearing, and smell, in a sense. Like a baby initially cannot see or hear, and cannot speak, etc. The first and only sense they have is touch. Therefore, touch is a very fundamental and quite ancient sense, so to speak. Then maybe there is hearing, and it is not clear whether they have a sense of smell, but initially, they may not have it, and they are all in the water. They do not even know where to breathe, maybe from the navel <small>(laughs)</small>. And maybe they have it later. Vision is very late to develop because they may have weak eyesight initially. They should be quite dependent on touch, taste, and smell at first, but later, we focus more on visual and audio-visual education, and sensory education. And maybe cognitive education. Touch is a less significant part. So I think it is actually largely a decision made after birth. But in fact, this is also why many smells, such as when you smell a certain fragrance, "ah, it reminds me of the taste of home" or, "ah, it reminds me of the food my grandmother used to make", or "ah, this is my mother's smell". They always link to many memories because they are so fundamental and closely related to our subconscious. So they are that kind of thing that seems to directly connect to the fundamental channel. But if you look at something, you may be like "ah, I think this looks like..."
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; There is more processing…
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Yes, and in fact, when you look at a picture, you are actually using your whole body's perception. For example, when you see someone's post on social media about going to the beach, you might say, "I'm so jealous!" Why are you jealous? It's because you may have memories of going to the beach in the past and how great it felt, like the feeling of sand and sea breeze. Or if it's a picture you took yourself, the reason you appreciate it is also because when you look at the photo, it triggers various memories and emotions. So, is visual perception really unrelated to other senses? It doesn't have to be.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; When I watched your new movie last time, especially when I saw the shadow touching and caressing the grass or plants, even though it's a film and I was just watching it with my eyes, I still kept imagining what it would feel like to actually touch that grass…
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; That's the effect I wanted. Yes, you should try it next time.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; I remember you said that you also keep imagining when you're shooting…
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Actually, you don't really need to imagine. You just need to pay attention... Maybe everyone needs some imagination to some extent. Actually, as long as you're not randomly flailing, I think you should be able to feel something. You can imagine that your hand is actually touching something, and besides that, you don't need too much additional attention. And then you'll naturally feel it when you see your shadow—maybe this is a bit like your avatar. Your shadow is actually your avatar, and the hand of your avatar is moving back and forth on this grass, creating a texture. And this texture, on the one hand, is connected to your body, and on the other hand, it's purely visual—the texture itself is a tactile thing. I think it's like animation, it's a very tangible visual existence, so these two aspects together make it a very tactile experience.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; I was noticing that you often mention running. I feel that running is a sport that opens up the body's senses.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Actually, I just finished writing a short article about my feelings on running. My thoughts are actually somewhat opposite to that. However, I do agree that running is a sport with very strong sensory feelings, but I feel that the sensations are internal. For me, it is a very closed-off state. Like I complained to you before, when I run a 10k race, I find the cheering crowds very annoying. They can't let me focus, and they throw off my rhythm. Especially in the early stages of running when it's harder, before hitting the point of ease. I feel like I'm locking myself in a cage, building walls around me, adjusting my breathing, enduring through it, controlling my pace and rhythm. It's a struggle.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; Suffering <small>(laughs)</small>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Yes, suffering because you're mostly concerned with how tired and sore you are, and how you don't want to run anymore. And then there are the aches and pains, and sometimes it's cold. You battle with your body during this time. For me, it's a feeling of battling with myself, and at this time, I really don't want any external interference. I'm battling with the wind in front of me, and I don't want to be disturbed by any sound or the intense sun. You don't really have time to think about anything else, your whole attention is focused on how to fight back against your body's various struggles. I feel like the sense of touch in running is created more from these battles. It's a reactive sport, in my opinion.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; I actually agree with what you said. Although I haven't really been seriously running marathons, I used to run just for fun, like along the riverbank or something like that. But when I run, whether it's along the riverbank or in the park, I prefer to run outdoors and I don't like running on a treadmill. But even when I run outdoors, I don't really have the mood to appreciate the environment or scenery around me. I think what you said is right, it's really all about yourself. Even when I'm looking at the scenery in front of me, I'm thinking about how far I have to go, or the slope in front of me, or what the road conditions are like. And all the feelings I have, like the wind, temperature, or smell, I think I really turn all of these things into just how they affect my current physical condition.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Yes, and then you have to adjust.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; Yes, that's right. And then you have to think about how to deal with it. Like I feel cold, I feel hot, I feel like the wind is too strong, and then I feel really tired, and so on.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Yes, that's right. And including when it's really cold, you say to yourself, "Just run, and you'll warm up." It's like a soldier blocking the water and covering the earth. And actually, in the park, I think these views are really just less annoying. It can't help you a lot, but being less annoying is already the biggest help. Of course, there are things like distracting your attention. That's why sometimes when you're running, you might want to watch a video. If you're on a treadmill or something like that, I sometimes listen to music or something just to avoid getting too tired, but often, if you're really into your running, you don't know what you're listening to. In the end, you're just stuck in your own vortex. But that's why one time later, when the temperature was about 23 degrees outside and it was especially comfortable, with spring scenery and a mix of sun and clouds, not too hot and a slight breeze, while I was running outside, I suddenly felt like, "Wow, this is amazing!" Then, I started walking instead of running. <small>(laughs)</small> Because I felt like running was wasting this beautiful weather. At that moment, I realized that I had never had such a profound experience with walking before, and that walking and running are completely different experiences. While walking, you just feel like, "Wow, those flowers are so beautiful," and "Mmm, it smells so good," and "Oh, the breeze is so gentle."
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; Taking a walk is really about receiving information from the outside world.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Yes, and especially when you're determined to take a walk.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; Yes, if you are really focused on walking, you become very attentive to appreciating the surrounding environment.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; And you become very attentive, like to the temperature, the wind, they are no longer objects that you resist, instead you slowly absorb them and merge with them. So I think both experiences are interesting. But they are also important sources of experience.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; I really feel that when running, it really...I feel like it amplifies those sensory messages that you may not pay much attention to on a regular basis.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Yes, that's right.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; And they all become something that you need to battle and adjust to.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; You can't appreciate them, most of the time you only feel like, "fuck."
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; Really, because it's all based on how you can continue running.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Yes, why people run is completely to make themselves suffer.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; This sport itself is a process of battling with yourself.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; I think different sports give you different experiences, like swimming, and even before I practiced push hands, like Tai Chi push hands. Each sport has its own philosophy, and there are really a lot of sensory materials to be found, and I think they are all very physical in terms of learning and change...including the impact running has had on me...I think you may know that running really has a big impact on a person. Different types of running, for example, I started running because of the 800 meter exam.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; Did you practice specifically for the 800 meter?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Yes, I was really serious about it. We needed to run 800 meters for the high school entrance exam. Three minutes and thirty seconds was the full score. You know how intense the competition is for the middle school entrance exam, it's like feeling that one point can mean thousands of people difference. So, everyone aimed for a full score. I trained hard for it. I still remember my final score vividly—2'48"—it was the fastest I've ever run <small>(laughs)</small>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; Wow, that's really amazing.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Yeah, I think I reached the level of a semi-athlete. It's something I can always brag about... but I can never run that fast again.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; It's really inspiring.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Yeah, because I don't have the motivation to run anymore. Of course, at that time, there was also the pressure of taking the exam, but I think running has become a spiritual training for me. You think about running in that situation, and then add the feeling of battling against everyone, like "I want to beat everything." And even when you're exhausted, you say to yourself, "Can I run one more lap?" and then continu  <small>(laughs)</small>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Kai</b>&emsp; Talking to yourself?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Leilei</b>&emsp; Yeah, like saying, "If you run one more lap, you can succeed, you can get into your dream school." I think that period of time was probably one of my strongest moments of self-control, where I could sit in the library and do problems all day long. But looking back now, I can't do it anymore. It was too stressful, and I wasn't happy. Later on, I realized, "Why is running so unhappy?" I became like you, just running for fun, taking it slow and easy. And when it comes to doing things, like making art or working, I always consider how to make it more comfortable, with the feeling that being happy is the most important thing. But I think this kind of physical learning experience ultimately affects my entire work style and interpersonal relationships.
