            <p class="question">Excuse me, have you seen my kite string anywhere......</p>
            <p class="fullquestion">Excuse me, have you seen my kite string anywhere...... Uhm, I actually don't know
                what it looks like. I mean, I haven't seen it since I got this kite. But you see, it's following my
                hand! There must be a string between us......I just need to check if it's getting old, snapped, or
                tangled up somewhere. There have been a few times when my kite didn't respond to me, suddenly
                disappeared, or looped on its own. For safety's sake, I've got to keep my kite under control, away from
                planes, animals, crowds, viruses, and scams. The cloud can be very dangerous sometimes, you know. But
                with the string, I will never lose my kite. It is like a promise. Like a 'see you soon' from a loved
                one. Sometimes it's all we need, right? A line we can hold onto, knowing the other is there at the other
                end......Anyways, I'm searching for the string, if you happen to spot it, just tie a bow on it, and I
                will track it down. Thanks for your help!<br><br>
